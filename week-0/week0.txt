Problem statement number 3 

 
Project Title- DigiLand (A blockchain based land information portal with hash-based 
tamper detection) 

 
Problem Statement- The Land Ownership and encumbrance data in Delhi is very scattered and there are multiple portals like DORIS (urban), DLRC (rural), CERSAI (loan 
encumbrances), and MCA21 (corporate charges). These systems operate independently of each other, use different formats, and need users to manually cross-check information each time. This fragmentation causes insufficiencies, inconsistency in data, makes tampering, and fraud easy. 
 
This compromises trust, delays property transactions, and increases the risk of fraudulent registrations. Therefore, there is a need for a platform that integrates all the data across the four platforms and creates a single platform where the data can be accessed using standard inputs. 
 
Additionally, a blockchain-based hashing mechanism can ensure tamper detection, as any unauthorized change in data will result in a mismatch between stored hash values and the recomputed ones.
